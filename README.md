### What the project does
Considering the heterogeneous form of the repertoire of actions that can occur in the same field, in this project social movements in Italy are analyzed, in particular trade unions. Going more into details, the focus will be on the repertoire of actions of Cgil and SiCobas. 
We define these as “different” for two reasons: first, because from an institutional point of view, they are recognized as two different unions under the
same trade unions field. Second, because of the quite accentuated diversity of many of their characteristics, starting from the fact that Cgil is a confederate trade union, with more than five million members and eighty years of history, while SiCobas is an inter categorical relatively newborn trade union, with fewer members.

The two datasets here below briefly described were given to us by the professor, from a personal research she is conducting. For this reason, there is no dataset in this repository. 
#### *Quantitative analysis (stata)*
##### Dataset: Pilati, K., Perra, S., Frazzetta, F., Savina, M., Salaorni, V., Ingallina, F.,. Methodological codebook on labor-related collective actions. Italy 2008-2018; 2020; 2021; 2019-2023. Draft version January 2024
The dataset includes small-scale labor related collective actions, collected from local editions of “La Repubblica”, one of the main italian newspapers. These local editions are about the cities of Bari, Bologna, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Parma, Rome and Turin. The articles were considered if published during the month of January in three consecutive years, that are 2008, 2009 and 2010.

#### *Qualitative analysis (Atlas.ti)*
##### Dataset: (2023) Semi-structured interviews in the logistic sector in Bologna
The dataset includes thirty eight semi-structured interviews conducted between June 2022 and February 2023 with union officers and shop stewards, specifically members of RSA (Rappresentanza sindacale aziendale) or promoters of collective actions. The study focused on the city of Bologna considering the two trade unions, SiCobas and Cgil. Differentiation of case-study firms on the grounds of size as defined by the number of employees, workforce gender composition, and prevailing union among the workforce. From this dataset we codified twenty interviews, specifically ten with SiCobas members and the other ten with Cgil.

### Why the project is useful
This project reports the different approaches that a trade union could have in terms of management of work in companies, negotiation for workers’ rights, mediator between workers and employers.
